1. Based on the reports of your fellow classmates during our last class (2021-09-08), please briefly summarize any new ideas for apps to solve people’s problems that you have come up with as a result of listening to other students.

Have not had discussion in class yet

2. Several people mentioned the “conflict” between the desire to have a free app, and developers’ desire (and need) to get compensated. Can you suggest any ways by which developers can reap their creativity’s and efforts’ rewards without alienating their “customer base” by inundating with ads and/or charging them.

An option that a developer can implement is giving the users the OPTION to pay for extra benefits within the app - that way they are not forced and can have the choice to do so.
IAnother option could be to provide merch to the users.


3.Please point to any app/software/website that offers in your opinion an excellent UI/UX. Briefly explain in what ways you find its UI/UX to be so good.

Airbnb - I find the UI for airbnb to be very well made. They prioritize convenience for their customers and make it easy to start booking a stay right at the home screen. This allows users to go straight to what they want. They also implemented a method of suggestions by asking the user what they can help with and have some options for shortcuts to go straight to what the user wants such as homes, experiences, or restaurants. The whole process is friendly and approachable.

4. Have last class’s discussions and/or items #1-3 gotten you closer toward a mobile app you would like to pursue as a project for this course? Please discuss briefly.

I've been thinking about creating a geo-based alarm at for users but currently it is just an idea.
